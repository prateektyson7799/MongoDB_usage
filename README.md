How to use MongoDB by Node.js

Make sure that MongoDB is installed.

1. Open the terminal and go to the path where the file is located.
2. Execute the file ‘main.js’ through npm. 
3. The input files should be in the same folder as the location of the program file.

NOTE : 
1. The program provides all the outputs in the terminal.
2. The program will create databases and connections in the MongoDB local client “27017” as it is hardcoded in the code.
3. The MongoDB server should be up and always running at this port
for the program to run.
